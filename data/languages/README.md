# Translating Stendhal

___NOTE:__ localization is still a work-in-progress_


## Locale File Format

The file format is simple. It is a plain text file with each line representing either a translatable string or a comment
(a line beginning with "#"). Comments and empty lines are ignored by the translation interface. Each line for a
translatable string is made up three parts:

1. The original string (usually in English).
2. A "=" separator.
3. The locale's translation of the original string.

Example of translating the item name "dress" to Spanish:

```
dress=vestido
```


## New Translations

1. Make sure the desired locale file does not already exist.
2. Copy the template (`data/languages/template.txt`) to a new file with the desired locale code.

    Example for Spanish: `data/languages/template.txt` -> `data/languages/es.txt`

3. Open the new locale file in a text editor.
4. Add the locale's equivalent translations to each string following the "=" separator.

___NOTE:__ if a string should not be translated, simply delete the line_


## Updating Translations

1. Open the appropriate translation file in a text editor (example: `data/languages/es.txt`).
2. Find the string to be translated and update locale translation following the "=" separator.
3. If the string does not exist in the file simply add it followed by a "=" separator and the locale translation.
